# Reinforcement Learning Basics

RL takes place as a conversation between an agent and an environment.

The environment reveals itself to the agent as state s. The agent can impact the environment via some action a and receives a feedback r.

This is similar to MDP, however instead of having all of the knowledge and computation done over the environment, it's all occurring "in the head" of the agent. Furthermore details of the environment are only exposed to the agent. All of the possibilities aren't really known unless an action is taken.
